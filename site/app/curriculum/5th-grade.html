            <p>This year is in the middle of the “heart of childhood” and for a “short moment each child is poised at the crest of the wave….”   Physically, they have achieved an ease and grace of movement.  Emotionally, the whole class has left the stormy seas of the nine-year-change and now rests in the eddy.  Socially, the class has worked the past year on respecting individuals while acting as a unit.  Intellectually, they have developed a greater capacity for conceptual thought and understanding right from wrong in a “reasoning spirit.” Altogether, they are ready for more challenges.  The primary objective for this year is to develop a greater consciousness of the interrelatedness of all things.</p>
            <h3 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Fifth Grade Curriculum</h3>
            <p>The work begun in fourth grade is continued in fifth and with such detail that a new attentiveness and alertness is required.  With enthusiasm, love, and deep interest, conceptual facts are continually brought before the children, fostering an enduring and loving connection with the natural world.  New subjects taught include Ancient History and Botany.  Geography is expanded to include all of North America. </p>
            <p/>
            <p>Provided below is a general overview of the fifth grade curriculum.  The specifics of the curriculum for this grade will be shaped by the class teacher.        </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Form Drawing</h4>
            <p>Form drawing this year begins to enter the field of mathematics by focusing on freehand geometrical drawing, without compasses or rulers, in which the various geometric forms are woven or intertwined about each other.  Beauty and form is combined with accuracy to create truly artistic drawings.  Geometry is thus first introduced through the arts.  </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Language Arts, Ancient History, and Geography</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:262px;height:180px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/5th_geography.jpeg" alt="Geography"/>
            <p>Language arts is taught as part of many different blocks, including Ancient History and Geography.   Ancient History is introduced to the children in the context of the evolution of human consciousness, with a focus on the cultural life and mood of the time.  As these civilizations encompass Egypt, Greece, the Middle East, India, and China and their influences are felt to this day, the interrelatedness of life is emphasized.  In Geography, all of North America is studied, including geographical, economical and social ties of the various North American countries with each other and with other continents.  The Geography block is intended to be multidisciplinary.  Thus a description of each region visited also includes a discussion of geology, botany, comparative zoology, and meteorology.  Stories in both blocks focus primarily on individuals and their lives and contributions.  With these individuals as backdrop, the children then practice writing from different viewpoints and with different inflections, using direct vs. indirect speech and active vs. passive verbs, and by varying sentence structure and punctuation.  The children’s compositions thus become more varied in texture and tone, reflecting their rich inner life.  These different writing voices accentuate for the children when they are writing about what they think and when they are writing about what someone else thinks.  This paves the way for the children finding their own voices in life.  Of course, reading, spelling, dictation, letter writing, and grammar are continued.            </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Mathematics</h4>
            <p>Just as Ancient History (and thus language arts) spans the entire evolution of human consciousness, fifth grade mathematics is a complete review of all math topics introduced since first grade.  The children’s enthusiasm for work is harnessed to ensure a strong foundation in all four processes with small and large numbers, long division, factoring, and fractions.  Decimals and the metric system are the only new topics introduced.  The Pythagorean theorem is derived.  Ancient numbering systems are introduced as part of the Ancient History block.  </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Science / Nature Studies</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-left" style="width:110px;height:144px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/5th_report.jpeg" alt="State Report"/>
            <p>Science in fifth grade focuses on Botany.  The evolution from lower to higher plants are examined and compared to the developmental stages of the child.  The quietness and slower pace of the life of plants (as compared to humans or animals) encourage the children to deepen their observational skills with patience.  While the colors and fragrance of the plants and flowers engage their interest and emotions.  The earth is seen as a living entity.  The children’s careful observations are reproduced in drawings and paintings, reinforcing the soul connection developed during their plant studies.  These studies provide a foundation for future studies of botany tied to geography.  </p><br /><br />
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Painting and Art</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:104px;height:136px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/5th_art.jpeg" alt="Art"/>
            <p>By now, the children will have gained enough mastery over the watercolor painting techniques to create detailed portraits of humans, dramatic scenes from stories read or told during main lesson, and the delicate beauty of the plant world.  In art classes, the children will continue to deepen their artistic skills in other mediums.  Please see the section entitled “Art Programs” for more details concerning art classes for the grades.  </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Handwork</h4>
            <p>The fifth grader is beginning to catch a glimmer of the interrelatedness of all things.  More than anything, they feel balanced intellectually, emotionally, and physically, and with this balance comes the intuitive understanding of how the intellect, emotions, and body come together to create a harmonious whole.  We underscore this feeling of balance and harmony by teaching the children how to make a pair of socks by knitting in the round.  In this knitting technique, each row is connected to the one before and what was done once must be repeated exactly again to create a matching pair of socks.  The fifth grader is also asked to write down what he/she did, thereby creating a knitting pattern as well as learning how to follow knitting patterns provided in books and magazines.   </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Spanish</h4>
            <p>The fifth grade Spanish lesson begins with a recitation of a poem and the singing of a song.  Later, oral exercises are recited followed by learning vocabulary with the use of physical response.  In this grade, the children reach a certain high point in the topography of language education.  They can read with proficiency and understand the spoken word with ease in the classroom environment.  Writing exercises continue as well as the study of grammar.  Testing, quizzes, dictations, and homework are given as an integral part of the language lesson.  Reminiscent of previous years’ lessons, games are also developed in this grade.</p>
