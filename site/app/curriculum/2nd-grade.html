	        <p>The children make a great leap from first to second grade, perhaps one of the biggest leaps in their school career.  Writing, which was virtually an extension of drawing in first grade, now stands on its own; numbers, whose qualitative aspect was stressed last year, now are recognized as quantities, extending in space and time.  The world of fairy tales, although not completely absent, now makes way for fables and the lives of the saints.  These saint stories are inspiring biographies of men and women with an historical verity.</p>
	        <p>If the circle is a picture of first grade, all whole and unified, each part sustaining the rest, then second grade may be seen as two parallel lines.  For the child is no longer carried by the dreamy sense of security in all that encircles him, but begins to experience a delicate quality of “apartness,” and “identity.”  At this age, criticalness may suddenly appear.  There may also be a tendency to squabble endlessly or to feel persecuted by “everybody.”  Some may feel bereft of friends.  The fables point out human foibles that suddenly appear so clearly to the second grader.  In contrast, the saints’ legends calm, console and reassure them that we can indeed rise above our baser instincts. </p>
	        <h3 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Second Grade Curriculum </h3>
			<img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:222px;height:152px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/2nd_studying.jpeg" alt="Studying"/>
	        <p>Second graders continue their studies with the following core subjects:  form drawing, language arts, mathematics, science, painting and art, gardening, music, handwork, games, drama, Spanish, German, speech, and eurythmy.  Each subject is brought in an enlivened and developmentally appropriate way which is made relevant to the child through activities that move the physical body and artistic endeavors that move the soul.</p>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Form Drawing</h4>
			<img class="nmg-curriculum-left" style="width:132px;height:100px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/2nd_form_drawing.jpeg" alt="Form Drawing"/>
	        <p>We start the year with form drawing, introducing more complex running forms and exploring the transformation of forms.  After the introduction of cursive writing, we then focus on ‘mirrored’ forms.  These forms help children to ‘see’ the other side of the equation through their drawing.  In mirroring a form, the child has to be able to see its sister form across the horizontal or vertical midline and be able to recreate it with accuracy.  As in first grade, form drawing integrates the whole body as we walk, run, draw in the sand with chalk or our feet, sculpt with our bodies, and eventually bring the form to the page with crayon.  </p>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Language Arts</h4>
			<img class="nmg-curriculum-left" style="width:326px;height:132px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/2nd_lang_arts.jpeg" alt="Language Arts"/>
	        <p>The budding ability to read in first grade is now expanded and strengthened.  The children are now at a point where they can start to create their own sentences, with the aid of the teacher, as they recall yesterday’s story of a great being or fable.  The teacher writes this on the board as they collaborate in capturing the essence of the story.  Finally, the children write it for themselves as they author their own main lesson books and enliven them with pictures.  As the year progresses, grammar is introduced with liveliness and humor by acting out stories in which the children can experience the contrast between doing words, naming words and describing words. </p>
	        <p/>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Mathematics</h4>
			<img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:264px;height:168px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/2nd_math.jpeg" alt="Mathmatics"/>
	        <p>In second grade, the children’s understanding and practical knowledge of the four processes are deepened.  Their mental agility and fluency with numbers are strengthened.  Through stories and games, the children will expand the size of the numbers with which they can confidently work.  Place value is reviewed and expanded upon to encompass numbers in the millions, and the concept of regrouping (formerly referred to as borrowing and carrying) are introduced.  The children will expand their acuity with the multiplication tables up to 12x12, which will continue to be reinforced for the next several grades.  Manipulatives are still used, but more and more focus is placed on mental math as the children internalize their knowledge of numbers.  </p>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Science / Nature Studies</h4>
			<img class="nmg-curriculum-left" style="width:275px;height:184px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/2nd_nature.jpeg" alt="Nature Studies"/>
	        <p>Nature study continues with hikes every Friday with the first grade.  In this combined class, the children will explore nature with their five senses through quiet observation, silent listening, songs, stories, and play.  In addition, once a month they will gather at Sanborn Park with the third graders and older kindergartners.  They will also take trips to the beach, farm and other venues that will enhance the children’s exposure to nature in all its beauty and forms.  </p>
	        <p>What they discover and observe on their nature walks will then be recorded in their nature journals.  Main lesson work will also be brought out of the children on the nature walks:  reciting times tables as they march up the mountain, singing seasonal songs, drawing forms in the dirt with a stick, creating geometric forms with branches, or simply trying to figure out how to fit 15 people in four cars.  Most importantly, the children start to find themselves and their place in the world at a deeper level, through the challenges (rain, cold, steep climbs) and majesty of the natural world.  </p>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Painting and Art</h4>
			<img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:177px;height:198px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/2nd_art.jpeg" alt="Art"/>
	        <p>Our Art Program in the grades begins with watercolor painting in first grade, under the guidance of the class teacher.  Starting in second grade, art classes led by a variety of local artists as well as our art teacher, Ms. Margalit, will be offered to the children once a week.  In addition to water color painting, which the class teacher will continue to lead, they will now explore other art mediums including the fabric arts, bees wax modeling, clay sculpting and potting, painting with various  kinds of paint (oils, pastels, and acrylic), paper modeling, weaving and other fine arts.  These activities are all integrated into the curriculum to bring another side to the learning, reinforcing what they have learned and bringing it deeper into their soul life.  Please refer to the section entitled “Art Programs” for more details about art classes for the grades.    </p>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Music</h4>
	        <p>Music continues to deepen as the second graders become more fluent with their recorder and/or pentatonic flutes.  Music theory and note reading are brought along further through games and fun activities.  Listening, however, continues to be the most important facility being developed.  Students mimic the tones their teacher makes with their recorder and their voices. Mr. Newton and Ms. More move the children along in song and games and introduce various instruments to enhance their appreciation, dexterity and musical skill.  Although formal music class is once per week, each day is filled with singing and flute playing.  Also, each Wednesday the kindergartners and first and second graders come together for singing games with Ms. Rainville.  </p>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Handwork</h4>
	        <p>Handwork skills progressed rapidly in first grade, and the students are now ready to take on more complicated projects.  Purling and crocheting will be introduced, and the children will create practical (wash cloths) and fun (gnome dolls) items that they will be able to use and treasure.  Their math and cognitive skills are enhanced as they plan their projects and keep constant track of where they are.  Neurological development is nurtured.  It is said that the hands are the window through which the brain develops.  The stillness and repetition of the purling allow time for inner contemplation and reflection.   The pride of accomplishment when they finish their hard labored efforts is unlike anything else.   </p>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Spanish</h4>
			<img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:207px;height:145px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/2nd_watching.jpeg" alt="Watching"/>
	        <p>Spanish is brought twice a week to a combined class of first and second graders.  The class enjoys being able to learn an elementary conversation and retain expressions.  Establishing a vocabulary and developing the skill for understanding the spoken language is satisfying for them.</p>
	        <br />
	        <p>As usual, the lesson begins with a greeting, and reciting a poem or a riddle followed by tongue twister and a song.  The children learn these activities by imitation.  A new vocabulary or a review of previously introduced vocabulary follows the flow of the lesson.  Active games, commands, and folk dances add physical activity to the lesson, which contributes to recall, and offers some freedom of movement.  Listening to short stories, fables, and folk tales leads to a very calm ending of the class.</p>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">German and Speech	</h4>
	        <p>German and speech are brought to the first and second graders in a combined class twice a week.  Second graders continue developing conversational skills and vocabulary in German.  They also continue exploring the power of speech through recitations, songs, movement, and games, while developing an intuitive understanding of how we relate to the world.   </p>
	        <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Eurythmy, Dramatic Arts, Gardening and Games </h4>
	        <p>These classes continue to further develop the children’s social and physical skills as well as their appreciation for nature, other people and cultures, their own bodies and their developing inner awareness.  </p>
