        	<h3 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Early Childhood Program Overview</h3>
        	<p>The environment of the early childhood program is a sanctuary designed to foster the young child’s physical and spiritual development. Working in partnership, the teachers and parents assure children that the world they experience is good. Adults strive to cultivate human virtues of reverence for life, compassion for others and stewardship of the kingdoms of nature.</p>
        	<p>The teachers are concerned with being role models worthy of the child’s capacity to imitate. Equally important is the teacher’s inner attitude. The young child’s soul life is nurtured through these transitional years by authenticity in all materials bring harmony to the senses.</p>
        	<p>The early childhood teaching staff works with parents in meeting the physical-constitutional needs of the children by nurturing and bringing health to the senses of touch, warmth, movement and balance. For example, children eat whole-grain; organic snacks dress appropriately for the seasonal weather, and have plenty of outdoor time as well as indoor activities.</p>
        	<p>The kindergarten environment and program nurture the young child’s natural born gift of awe and wonder. To begin with, the teacher holds the image of the child as a spiritual being. Time is created during the rhythm of the day for a mood of reverence reconnecting the children to their spiritual base.</p>
        	<p>In circle time, the children participating in songs, finger plays, movement and rhymes related to the seasons or festivals. The door opens on a play garden where the child can discover and reconnect to the mysteries of the universe. Seasonal festivals help root the children in the continuity of time through song, dance, craft and food. Cultural and religious traditions and customs are honored, and new ones are created to meet the needs of our times.</p>
        	<p>Fairy tales are spiritual truths clothed in pictures that speak to the young child .They give an imaginative glimpse into the development of an individual human soul. Each day the children listen with rapt attention as the teacher tells a tale. They will act out these tales in their play, thus working with recall and memory skills in highly creative way.</p>
        	<p>Through learning to master domestic skills, the child takes his or her part in civilizing his world. For example, children participate in baking bread, forming the leaves, smelling the inviting smells from the oven and delighting in the taste of the freshly baked loaf. They learn to mop and clean and find joy in working together to make their rooms clean, ordered and beautiful. These activities serve to educate the senses and help the child gain a sense of their body geography and spatial orientation. Fine motor skills are educated as children sew and complete useful and practical projects.</p>
        	<p>Play is the genius of childhood. In play, children learn about themselves in relation to their environment, in which includes those around them. Practice in problem solving, compromise and conflict resolution is an everyday experience gained during creative free play. Development of imaginationative, metaphoric play leads to critical thinking skills in later years. As the materials lend themselves to metamorphic process, where in one day a piece of wood is a pretend loaf of bread and the next, it is a little dog, the children receive the gift of seeing how imagination transforms their world. They engage in play with logs, rocks, cloths, and wooden crates for a long and uninterrupted time period. Through such long sustained play with no primary interruption, deep thinking skills are built.</p>
        	<p>Schools are called on to become more than traditional institution, they are community centers where trust is built between people who share common values. Along with parent evenings, there is a strong adult education program and opportunities to participate in activities that enliven and deepen the sense of community. Parents come to understand the Early Childhood Center and where people celebrate and share passages of life</p>

        	<h3 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Elementary-Grade 1 through 5 Program Overview</h3>
        	<p>Waldorf education tells a human story from archetypes of the fairy tales to where we stand in this millennium. Curriculum guidelines based on the lawfulness of human development according to the indications of Rudolf Steiner are consistent throughout Waldorf movement worldwide. The teacher’s challenge is to understand thoroughly these indications and the reasoning behind them. Current brain research supports an increasing number of Waldorf practices. With that basic foundation, the teacher is then free to form the year’s curriculum, choose among many content sources, and determines the timing and sequence of blocks and how the basic developmental themes of the year will permeate all the lessons.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">First Grade</h4>
        	<p>The lessons of the first grade are presented through the motif of the fairy tale, which holds time honored pictorial truths. Rich in language and pictures, fairy tales from many cultures provide a background for an imaginative introduction to the world of letters and numbers. Movement, the gateway to learning, inspires rhythmic exercise for coordination, concentration and cooperation in math and language arts. The year is filled with new friendships, discoveries and achievements.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Second Grade</h4>
        	<p>The second grade student has stepped from the embrace of the circle, no longer is there the family unity of the fairy tale world. The child begins to sense a glimmer of separateness and the experience of a certain duality. The stories of second grade are multicultural animal fables with the rascal tendencies of our instinctive nature balanced with the stories of men and women who by goodness and devotion rise selflessly above human limitation. Language arts math skills deepen through continued practice.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Third Grade</h4>
        	<p>In third grade the students begin to experience what is called the Nine-Year Change and leave behind their early childhood experience of comfort and belonging. The stories of the Hebrew people, from the creation and making order out of chaos to learning to live on the earth, capture the theme of survival. The children too can live and thrive on the earth through practical activities in creating shelters, clothing and caring for the earth.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Fourth Grade</h4>
        	<p>Fourth Graders experience themselves as separate, having a unique identity, and able to make choices and to think differently than n those around them. This feeling of separateness calls for separate subjects,fractions,grammar,local history, local geography, humankind and animal, Celtic knots, learning a stringed instruments, to name a few. The wakeful of the fourth grader demands a robust story curriculum to satisfy a sense of time and place. Colorful characters from Native American, Spanish explorer and pioneer tales appear in local geography and history while imperfect gods and goddesses meddling in human affairs inhabit the intriguing worlds of Norse mythology.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Fifth Grade</h4>
        	<p><img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:231px;height:300px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/ovw_botany.jpeg" alt="Botany project for 5th grade">In fifth grade comes the point of equilibrium for the growing child –that delicate balance between the imaginative younger child, whose thoughts dream into pictures, and adolescent, whose thoughts quicken towards analysis, cause and effect .Even the physical body shows this harmony, with its well-proportioned limbs and grace and skill of movement. Jump roping to riddles, rhymes and the Pentathlon events are excellent showcases for this physical beauty, as all the quick moving hockey matches in games class and the recess basket ball and a football games. Each child seemed to come into a period of grace ,a time of inner calm and confidence in Grade 5.The ancient civilization of India,Persia,Mesopotamia,Egypt and Greece provide fascinating tales from both Mythology and history. Botany and geography of North America expand the fifth grader’s awareness of their world.</p>

        	<h3 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">We strive to offer the following special subjects:</h3>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Eurhythmy</h4>
        	<p>Eurhythmy was developed by Rudolf Steiner and is taught exclusively in Waldorf schools. Eurhythmy has a unique position within the curriculum and, when applied appropriately at different aged and in different phases of development, is an important aid to human development. Eurhythmy is an art of movement that engages the whole human being, integrating bodily movement with movements that arise within the soul, thus creating a harmonious relationship between the soul-spiritual element and the body. In contrast to gymnastics, which aims to make the body fit, lithe, harmonious and free, eurythmy is essentially an artistic process. Gymnastic involves the whole human being coming into a relationship with the physical laws that govern levity and gravity and the balance between those two polarities.Eurythmy also works with the polarities of levity and gravity, not physically but essentially through the inner experience of the soul, with what can be called ensouled movement, it is therefore more a kin to dance than gymnastics. Though eurhythmy is a performing art, it’s also has important educational and therapeutic aspects. Practicing the elements of eurythmical movement helps the children become more graceful in their movement; more coordinated more alert and more at ease with themselves. What the children reveal in their movements can, to the practiced eye of the teacher, contribute to an overall picture of their potential and what must be overcome to release it.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Games/Movement</h4>
        	<p>The movement curriculum assists the development of the child’s sense of movement, spatial awareness, sense of balance and inner equilibrium. It gives children the sense of bodily well being, through fine and gross motor control. The movement curriculum seeks to help the children from and differentiate overall awareness and control of movement. It enables them to marshal their energies in the right place at the right times by directing those forces in a meaningful way. Rudolf Kischnick, the father of Waldorf movement education, summed up the goals of the curriculum succinctly, “We wish to develop in the children courage, endurance and presence of mind “This curriculum supports and complements the academic curriculum in age appropriate ways”.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Gardening Program</h4>
        	<p>Working in the garden provides an opportunity to develop an innate, harmonious sense of being at a home on this earth. It gives the children living examples of many of their class studies, in the garden their lessons can become practical, daily experiences .Through their work the children feel each contribution that they make to garden as a link in a long chain of others contributions at work. They experience firsthand “that people always depend on the work of their fellow human beings ‘(Steiner)They learn to work for the love of work ,for others and for sake of the whole rather than for personal gain. It gives them a basis for building true community. Working together and caring for the earth are the two basics themes of gardening classes. Other themes include nature observation, development of gardening skills and craft skills.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Handwork Program</h4>
        	<p>Knitting and other handwork projects play an important role in the development of fine motor skills, inner calm, and intellectual clarity. Handwork offers many opportunities for reinforcing math skills in practical, challenging, and enjoyable ways. In an article originally printed in “Head Heart and Hands: A Waldorf Family Newsletter,” published by the Green Mountain Waldorf School, author and Waldorf teacher Eugene Schwartz points out an event more valuable result: We cannot underestimate the self -esteem and joy that arises in the child as a result of having made something practical and beautiful-something which has arisen as the result of a skill that has been learned .In an age when children are often passive consumers, who as Oscar Wilde once said’ know the price of everything and the value of nothing ‘learning to knit can be powerful way of bringing, meaning into a child’s life.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Music</h4>
        	<p>Musical growth comes through experiences in listening, singing, playing, moving, creating, reading and performing music. Music learning involves actively being in the music and experiencing the musical element. In singing the child becomes the musical instrument and thereby experiencing feeling of contentment and well being. Singing is not only part of the music class, but the children sing songs in the main lesson and in other special project classes. The act of singing unfolds the child’s human qualities, especially those of the heart and will. Singing leads to instrumental playing and to an understanding of the art of music. Young children begin to experience rhythm and beat; the understanding and awareness of those elements comes in later grades.</p>
        	<p>The general objectives of the music curriculum in Waldorf education is to awaken the child to time, melody and rhythm, and later, harmony. Student learn to appreciate understand, and perform music through;</p>

        		<li>Singing</li>
        		<li>Rhythmic movement</li>

        		<li>Listening (live concerts, programs), learning good audience behavior</li>
        		<li>Performance in assembly and concerts</li>
        	</ul>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Second language-Spanish</h4>
        	<p>Second languages (i.e., languages other than the mother tongue) have been an integral part of the Waldorf Curriculum. The reason for this was not simply to add two languages to the curriculum, but rather to help develop the child as a human being .The children game a sympathic picture of the culture, geography, history of the countries and people whose language they are studying.</p>
        	<p>On a more individual level, lining a second language helps to develop and sharpen listening skills. The child hears something different from the mother tongue and need to make more of an effort .Students practice they are speaking skills from the first lessons, particularly in first three grades, before they begin to write in the language. They practice the sense of movement through rhythmical activities that are part of the lesson, especially during the first few school years.</p>
        	<h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Aftercare Program</h4>
        	<p>Our after-school program addresses the need of working parent who wants their children to receive quality afternoon care that is consistent with the principle of Waldorf education. It offers a safe, nurturing environment for kindergarten through 5 grade children.</p>
        	<p>The aftercare program staff includes director and assistants. The primary concern of these caring and responsible individuals is for the children safety and well being. The staff meets weekly to plan and discuss the activities of the Aftercare program. The Director and staff work with the faculty to provide consistency with the principles underlying Waldorf Education. The staff provides a harmonious environment with rhythm and structure, as well as many as opportunity for free playing, games, sand play, nutritious cooking and baking activities, crafts and many other activities. For the older children, the program uses a classroom for special indoor projects, activities or homework.</p>
