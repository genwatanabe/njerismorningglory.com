        		<p>Play at age 5 is of great importance not just to intellectual but emotional, psychological, social and spiritual development. Play — especially
the let's-pretend, dramatic sort — is how kids develop higher-level thinking, hone their language and social skills, [and] cultivate empathy.</p>

        	<p>A child’s day is full of creative play – perhaps painting or baking, singing, and a story. The content of kindergarten life at our school thus has a simplicity that the child can understand and imitate whole-heartedly.</p>
        	<p>The activities of baking, painting, gardening, singing, circle, storytelling and puppetry capture the children’s enthusiasm for the world. This becomes the mainspring of later learning. Our work as teachers is to nurture the physical development of the young child, while cultivating the positive human values of compassion, reverence for life, respect, love of nature and other people, and a social conscience, as well as developing cognitive, artistic and practical skills. The physical body is supported, and the soul life of the child is affirmed and nourished as the ground for healthy, active thinking.</p>

        	<p><img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:264px;height:176px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/kin-w-njeri.jpeg" alt="With Teacher Njeri">Our daily rhythm alternates carefully between expanding and contracting activities, such as outdoor and indoor creative play as well as alternating between inner and outer movement through story time and circle time.</p>
        	<p>Rhythm in the days of the week is established through the practical and artistic activities of bread baking, gardening, cooking, finger knitting, watercolor painting, woodworking and other imitative, purposeful, and meaningful activities. Once a week all the kindergarteners enjoy a Spanish circle and eurythmy (an activity combining music, movement and speech). In addition, older kindergarteners learn to play the recorder and once a month join the elementary students on a hike at a natural park. The celebration of the seasons and festivals marks the monthly rhythms.</p>
        	<p>For snack, we serve organic grains in addition to the bread and soup we make with the children every week. Every day, the children participate in making their food at school. For special holidays or festivals, special treats are prepared. Please let us know if your child has food allergies, so we may work with you to supply alternative snacks.</p>
        	<p>Special monthly events may include class meetings, various lectures and workshops. The changing of the seasons brings a cycle of festivals throughout the school year.</p>
