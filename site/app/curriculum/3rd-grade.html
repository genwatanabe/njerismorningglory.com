            <p>The child’s growing awareness of her separateness from the world culminates in a loss of childhood innocence – the “nine-year change.”  This change marks the further incarnation of the ego—the further individualization of the being.  As if what was spoken at two years of age, “I,” reverberates back as the louder, “I am alone!”  For some children, this may manifest in feelings of isolation, insignificance, and fear:  “I’m so small, and the world is so big.”  Some may feel an intense sadness.  Others may become highly critical of their peers and the world.  For many it is an emotional roller coaster.  For child and parent this is a taste of adolescence to come.</p>
            <h3 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Third Grade Curriculum</h3>

            <p>At this time, the child’s growing awareness of his separateness from the world, his parents, and others, culminates in a loss of his childlike innocence - the ‘nine year change.” The child is waking up, becoming more of an individual and more earthly. This new-found individuality can bring excitement and creative freedom, as well a highly critical attitude toward others. It is a small foreshadowing of adolescence. It is a crossing of the River Jordan, or the Rubicon, from which there is no turning back. While it is a substantial transition for the child to make, it can often be more difficult for the parents than for the child.</p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Form Drawing</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-left" style="width:140px;height:117px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/3rd_form_drawing.jpeg" alt="Form Drawing"/>
            <p>Form drawing in the third grade continues with symmetrical forms - given one side, the child is asked to complete the other. But we move on from the simple vertical and horizontal symmetries of first and second grades, to curved and circular symmetries. Forms become more complex and cross the axis or mid-line, strengthening the child’s left-right thinking connections. The child can also determine the basic pattern or archetype of a curved line form, and transform the same idea into straight lines, creating a different feeling in the process. Running forms, left to right, continue to be used as an aid to letter formation and cursive writing.</p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Language Arts</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:158px;height:138px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/3rd_lang_arts.jpeg" alt="Language Arts"/>
            <p>Hebrew legends from the Old Testament are used in third grade as a continuous story line throughout the year. Adam and Eve’s banishment from the Garden of Eden mirrors the child’s loss of the magic of early childhood.&nbsp; The ancient Hebrew people’s search for a homeland parallels a nine-year old searching for his or her place on earth. Along the way, he or she needs to develop trust in worthy leaders and develop a sense or moral authority within him or herself. The three basic parts of speech are introduced; naming words (nouns) as Adam used to name the animals, doing words (verbs) which tell us all the activities early people had to perform to survive, and describing words (adjectives and adverbs) which show the strong emotions one might feel along the way. Together, these words correspond to the three parts of the human being; thinking, feeling , and willing.&nbsp; In developing their sentences, the children follow the process from speaking, to writing, to reading. Spelling words are drawn out of the story content, and dictation exercises are used regularly. Children are encouraged to develop longer and more complex sentences. They begin to read in reading groups from chapter books such as Laura Ingalls Wilder’s “Farmer Boy”, exercising silent and oral reading skills, and testing their comprehension. &nbsp;Practical aspects of reading and writing are emphasized, such as writing letters, keeping journals, creating cookbooks, and reading fabric content labels on clothes.</p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Mathematics</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:176px;height:206px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/3rd_studying2.jpeg" alt="Studying"/>
            <p>Practical aspects of mathematics such as linear, liquid, weight, time, and temperature measurement, and denominations of money are introduced, as well as long division.&nbsp; All are explored in a hands-on fashion. Money, for example, is introduced first though ancient concepts of value and barter, and then through real-life situations such as creating a store and buying things. In addition to mental math “number journeys” and written problems, story problems are given which emphasize practical problem-solving. &nbsp;Two-digit multiplication is introduced, as well as long division, which incorporates several processes into one problem. Times tables begin to be memorized so they can be recalled in or out of sequence.</p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Practical Activities / Science / Nature Studies</h4>
            <p>Just like language arts and mathematics, science in third grade focuses on its practical application.&nbsp; Thus the children are taught gardening, farming (the seven grains), cooking, textiles (wool, cotton, silk, linen) and shelter building.&nbsp; A sukkah, or a simple temporary shelter, may be built at the time of Sukkot.  Sukkot is both a harvest festival and a time to remember the 40 years during which the children of Israel wandered in the desert. The children learn the experience not only of building, but of “doing without” as the ancient Hebrews did, by eating meals and living in the sukka for a period of time. Along this vein, the children may also be taught wilderness survival skills during their biweekly Friday nature says. All these practical activities, which may include sheep-shearing and silkworm raising, provide the children with hands-on experiences. They may later also serve as a physical basis for abstract concepts introduced in chemistry, physics, biology, meteorology, and astronomy.
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-left" style="width:223px;height:115px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/3rd_gardening.jpeg" alt="Gardening"/>
    &nbsp;They also strengthen the child’s confidence in their abilities to care for the physical self, while emphasizing the need to work with nature.&nbsp; The production and subsequent consumption of raw materials (such as in farming and cooking or shelter building) pave the way for future discussions of resource allocation, conservation, and environmental stewardship.  </p>
            <p>In addition, once a month, the third graders join the first and second graders and the older kindergartners at Sanborn Park or another nature preserve for an intimate experience with nature that may include creating art and team building activities.        </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Painting and Art</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:264px;height:198px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/3rd_house.jpeg" alt="House"/>
            <p>The children begin the year by painting the seven days of creation, bringing order and form out of void and chaos. Weekly painting classes continue to enliven the child’s soul through the simple use of color and color blending. In the third grade, form begins to emerge more strongly out of the color. Whether in painting or drawing, scenes from the Hebrew or farming stories can become more defined through simple gestures. Thick color pencils begin to be used in addition to beeswax crayons, in order to get more fine detail when illustrating stories in main lesson books. Beeswax modeling continues to be used as a means for drawing the parts out of the whole, and encourages the same process to be used while drawing. Please see the section entitled “Art Programs” for more details about art classes for the grades.    </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Music</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-left" style="width:212px;height:141px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/3rd_music.jpeg" alt="Music"/>
            <p>The practical nature of the third grade curriculum extends to the teaching of music. Just as physical things can be measured, so can invisible things, such as the space, or intervals, between musical tones. The children learn many folk songs, dances, and clapping games.&nbsp; They are able to enjoy a wealth of musical material from African American, Appalachian, and Hebrew traditions describing the events of the Old Testament. The children make the transition from the ancient 5-note pentatonic to the more closely packed and earthly 7-note diatonic scale, learn musical notation, and start to name the notes on the soprano recorder.&nbsp; They begin to sing in rounds, in their first attempt to develop a musical ego, holding their own while their neighbor is doing something else.   </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Handwork</h4>
            <p>Handwork in third grade focuses on providing the children with the experience of making cloth from which clothes can be made.  Thus taking the wool sheared from the sheep, we clean it, card it, spin it into yarn using a drop spindle we’ve made ourselves, and then dye the yarn with natural plant dyes.  From here we learn to cloth ourselves by using the yarn we’ve handspun ourselves to crochet hats.  </p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">Spanish</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:206px;height:128px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/3rd_spanish_play.jpeg" alt="Spanish Play"/>
            <p>In third grade we work through imitation with verses and songs about farming, cooking, and housing.&nbsp; Movements, gestures and dramatics are used&nbsp;to strengthen the emotional connection of the child with the language.&nbsp; </p>
            <br />
            <p>A general review of what the children learned last year initiates the year.&nbsp; Subsequently, we move on to conversational events using short plays about animals, vocabulary such as tools, parts of the body, clothes, the seasons, elements of nature, names of fruits and vegetables, toys used on the playground, the use of money, numbers, etc.&nbsp; We continue using bean bags, hiding games, jump ropes, memory games, and dances to lighten the flow of the lesson.</p>
            <h4 class="nmg-theme-text-curriculum">German and Speech, Eurythmy, Dramatic Arts, Gardening and Games </h4>
            <p>These classes continue to further develop the children’s social and physical skills as well as their appreciation for nature, other people and cultures, their own bodies and their developing inner awareness.  </p>

            <p>The third graders, now ready for more independence and responsibility, live for a short time without the comforts of home and family, by participating on a working farm for three to four days. They will learn how food is cultivated and how animals are tended to.  They develop a greater appreciation for the amount of work necessary to bring food to their tables. Children return from this trip with increased self-confidence.&nbsp; They have truly arrived on the earth – strong, capable, and ready to face new challenges.</p>
