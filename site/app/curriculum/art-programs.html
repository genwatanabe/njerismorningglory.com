Young hands connect to their minds through direct contact with textures and techniques. Art opens up children’s imaginations to see and share their transformations. When the imagination finds expression in the real world, children experience peace during powerful learning experiences. Young minds live in mysteries which become gradually meaningful as art gives children new ways to express themselves. The excitement of creating something new and the inner peace which comes from artistic expression builds confidence.</p>
        	<p>Our school is not only a preschool and elementary school, it is also an art center. Art is a healing force that is too often overlooked and undervalued. An affirmation on the need for art in children’s lives, entitled “Twenty Reasons Why Art is Good for Kids,” is provided as an addendum to this handbook. We encourage all parents to read this affirmation. It was developed by the Museum of Children’s Art in Oakland, California and gives pointers on how to discuss your child’s art work with him/her once it is brought home.</p>
        	<p>Through our Art Center we offer art classes to our school community and the greater community of children and adults.</p>

        	<p><img class="nmg-curriculum-left" style="width:249px;height:215px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/art_sewing2.jpeg" alt="Sewing">Our curriculum is steeped in the arts and addresses each growing child through movement, speech, form drawing, handwork, dramatic arts, music, gardening, and finally in separate art classes as well. These separate art classes begin in second grade and continue through fifth. They are taught by various local artists as well as our own resident artists: Njeri McGillicuddy and Joanne Margalit.</p>
        	<p>Many basic skills are acquired during the art classes offered to the grades. In the second through fifth grade classrooms, art classes are integrated with therogress of the main lessons as much as possible, but are always meticulously age appropriate. Art lessons are enriched through a connection to the specific seasons, tasks and stories of the curriculum at hand. Each art class also offers the children creative activities that move forward their mastery over their own bodies in specific ways. Gross and fine motor skills are enhanced, observation skills are introduced, hand eye coordination is developed and many other skills are acquired while the children enjoy creating their unique masterpieces in the brilliant light of great artist’s works.</p>
        	<p>For instance, the mobiles of Calder or the mosaics of Bufano are first carefully studied and observed and then later used to provide the children with artistic guidance from which they first imitate, then create freely within each great artist’s medium. The children are thus slowly led from observation to imitation to free artistic expression.</p>
        	<p><img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:207px;height:207px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/art_sewing.jpeg" alt="Sewing">At the same time, while enjoying and trusting their own creative impulses within each experience, the children learn basic skills such as:</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Drawing – with a variety of tools including colored pencil, charcoal, and pastels</li>
        		<li>Painting – with a variety of mediums including watercolor using the wet-on-wet or more traditional techniques, acrylics, and oils</li>
        		<li>Clay working – by hand and/or using pottery wheels</li>
        		<li>Woodworking</li>
        		<li>Sewing and dressmaking (by hand and with machine)</li>
        	</ul>
        	<p>Over the span of five years, the grades curriculum combined with the separate art classes are designed to nurture and further develop each child’s unique artistic sense and style. They will be familiar with the great works of art from diverse cultures and times and have a working knowledge of the technical language of art. They will also be comfortable and competent working with a wide range of artistic mediums. And lastly, they will gain a basic understanding of design and function and how the two can be merged to create beauty.</p>
