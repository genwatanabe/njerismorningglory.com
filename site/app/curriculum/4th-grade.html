            <p>By fourth grade, the child has entered well into the nine-year change and is negotiating its turbulent waters. By fifth grade, this will become the well-balanced “Golden Age”, but for now it is a stormy time. Children are literally bumping up against each other and the world, like the giants and magical beings that inhabit their stories. This is normal. Early childhood has been left behind, but the children have not yet entered puberty.&nbsp; The class has become a group of individuals, and now must struggle socially to find the most harmonious way to work together.&nbsp; In the students’ thought processes, there is a growing capacity for comprehending clear, factual concepts.&nbsp; Thus they have a great enthusiasm for learning about the world, and a strong will to learn.&nbsp; The challenge is to satisfy the child’s need for these concepts while maintaining an emotional connection with the natural and spiritual worlds.  </p>
            <h3>Fourth Grade Curriculum</h3>
            <p>The fourth grade curriculum recognizes the child’s growing awareness of the wider world by adding new subjects such as local history, local geography and a comparative study of the human being and animal.&nbsp; At the same time, the focus of drawing, painting, and music shifts increasingly to the aesthetic.&nbsp; In the lower grades, the formative forces inherent in the arts were consciously used to assist in the healthy development of the whole child.&nbsp; While this is still true, from fourth grade on, the focus of the arts is now directed more toward drawing, painting, or making music purely for their own sakes. The children are turned increasingly outwards toward meeting the aesthetic demands of the art form. Provided below is a general overview of the fourth grade curriculum.         </p>
            <h4>Form Drawing</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:136px;height:132px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/4th_form_drawing2.jpeg" alt="Form Drawing"/>
            <p>Form drawing in fourth grade focuses on knotted forms, where the child must follow a line of thought as it weaves in and out and over and under.  Working with these forms strengthens the child’s newly awakened capacity for conceptual thinking.  </p>
            <h4>Language Arts</h4>
            <p>The ancient Finnish epic “The Kalevala”, as well as the Norse myths, are brought to the children and form the basis of the language arts curriculum.&nbsp; These powerful tales are peopled with gods having diverse personalities and magical, if not quite omnipotent powers.&nbsp; They struggle against evil - as represented in the Norse Myths by Loki- and do not always win.&nbsp; These beings are living through a time of change when the old clairvoyance and man’s connection with the gods must die to make way for a new consciousness - the consciousness of self.&nbsp; This is the world of the fourth grader.&nbsp; With these tales as backdrop, the concept of verb tenses (simple past, present, and future) and the various parts of speech are introduced, while writing narrative and descriptive compositions continue to be practiced.&nbsp; Compositions might focus on describing one character or one scene – a part of the whole –&nbsp; reflecting the child’s growing individuality.&nbsp; Letter writing and journal keeping are continued, as well as dictation and spelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <h4>Mathematics</h4>
            <img class="nmg-curriculum-right" style="width:156px;height:173px;" src="assets/img/curriculum/4th_math.jpeg" alt="Mathmatics"/>
            <p>As the child now begins to take apart and examine the world, fourth grade mathematics deals primarily with the breaking down of numbers – factoring, working with prime numbers, and introducing the concept of fractions and their manipulation.&nbsp; Work with fractions represents the social struggle of the class to find wholeness while respecting each person’s individuality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Math puzzles and riddles, number patterns, logic problems, and math problems with special numerical answers are especially popular.&nbsp; Mental arithmetic is practiced daily.  </p>
            <h4>Science / Nature Studies</h4>
            <p>The fourth grader’s need for factual concepts must be balanced by a reverent connection with the natural world.&nbsp; Thus their first scientific study of the natural world focuses on the animal kingdom.&nbsp; Animals are chosen for these initial studies because of the children’s natural interest in and love for animals, and because physically, socially, and emotionally, animals share qualities with human beings.&nbsp; In particular, the eagle, lion, and cow are introduced. These animals correspond closely to the thinking, feeling, and willing aspects of the human being. &nbsp;This method of observation and characterization (comparing, contrasting, and looking at something in its natural environment) will be used throughout the next four years in all subjects, fostering the capacity to see the “big picture.” </p>

            <h4>Painting and Art</h4>
            <p>The children gain greater mastery over their watercolor technique, working on paintings of animals and the powerful images of the Norse gods.  Their art classes also reflect a growing complexity and greater focus on technique and fine detail.  Please see the section entitled “Art Programs” for more details concerning art classes for the grades.   </p>
            <h4>Music</h4>
            <p>Fourth grade music continues with round singing, of increasing complexity, now often in three parts. Quodlibets, or two different songs sung at the same time, are introduced as a kind of competitive fun, but also to pave the way for harmony singing in the fifth grade. The children experience the minor keys and a darker mood. Rhythm is brought more strongly into play, and Native American songs and chants may be used. The meter of 5/4, in which The Kalevala is written, is used as a tool for awakening the attention. <span>Children are encouraged to write and read their own melodies on the musical staff.</span> Complementing the fourth grade study of fractions, time signatures are introduced, where measures and note values are divided up into their fractional components. The physical constitution of the child is stabilizing at this time. By the end of the year, most children will arrive at the grown-up 4:1 ratio of pulse: breathing. <span>The gentle playing of flutes and recorders helps smooth this transition. Being in the heart of childhood, fourth grade is also the ideal time for the introduction of the stringed and bowed instruments:</span> violin, viola, and cello. Listening attentively, we feel the intimate connection of the sound and feeling of a bowed instrument, and the “heartstrings”.</p>
            <h4>Handwork</h4>
            <p><span>The fourth grader, with his strong will and developing ability to see others more clearly,</span><span> </span>are challenged in handwork with more detailed work.<span>  </span><span>The children are taught embroidery - using a delicate needle to pierce through a plain cloth to create beauty based on discipline and form.  They start the process by creating an abstract watercolor painting.  They then learn how to cross stitch.  </span>Using this new understanding of cross stitching, they then carefully plan out how they will reproduce their painting onto a plain cloth using colored thread.  </p>
            <h4>Spanish</h4>
            <p>We enter into a new and exciting <span>phase of the language in fourth grade.</span>  Gradually the children begin to write down some of the poems, stories and dialogues acquired in the lessons of the first three years.  It is essentially the task of this grade to learn to read the foreign language by way of writing.  The element of grammar is initiated by conjugating the verbs “to be” and “to have”. Reciting poems and singing <span>songs always is present as an opening of the les</span>son.</p>
            <h4>German and Speech, Eurythmy, Dramatic Arts, Gardening and Games </h4>
            <p>These classes continue to further develop the children’s social and physical skills as well as their appreciation for nature, other people and cultures, their own bodies and their developing inner awareness.</p>
