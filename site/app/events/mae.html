                After the moon rises, The Magical Autumn Evening is illuminated when the children walk through our beautiful new school with a lantern. In the Fall, as darkness gathers strength, the children go on a magical journey in the dusk, through woods or meadow. They encounter people, animals, fairies, gnomes, and other magical beings who, for one night, come alive straight out of our favorite fairy tales.<br><br>Though this event arrives near Halloween, THE MAGICAL AUTUMN EVENING is not a scary experience.<br><br>Join us for this unforgettable family experience.
