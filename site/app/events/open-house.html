            <p class="lead">We are seeking students for all programs and grades—preschool/ kindergarten (ages 2 to 5 years old) through 5th grade—and have openings now. However; this opportunity is for <b>parents only</b> to come understand our programs.</p>

            <p class="lead">Enjoy a tour of our amazing school, engage in a hands-on Waldorf experience, meet our teachers, and learn about our curriculum and what we have to offer.</p>

            <p class="lead">Among our unwavering values is our commitment to make this enriching and powerful education available to all families who want it and to keep our class size small. "Our school offers the broader community an opportunity to educate their children for the 21st century and into the future in an environment that is highly holistic, thoughtful, and engaging," says Njeri McGillicuddy, Waldorf teacher, master artist, and founder.</p>
