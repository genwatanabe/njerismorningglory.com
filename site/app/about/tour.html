            <p class="lead">The school is now enrolling our Nursery and Kindergarten through Grade 5 programs.</p>
            <p class="lead">For those interested in learning more about our programs, we offer tours each week on Thursday at 10:30 am. At that time, somebody will be available to show you our premises, tell you about our schooling and art offerings, and answer any questions you may have. Children are welcome to join you for your tour. To schedule your tour, contact the front office, either by phone or email, so that we can confirm you are coming and have somebody ready to answer your questions.</p>
            <p class="lead">If you have looked at our school and feel it would be a good fit for your family, please let us know by scheduling an interview. Interviews are offered on Tuesdays from 2:30 to 3:30. Interviews are an important part of the acceptance process, as they provide a unique opportunity for us to get to know you and your child, and help assess if our school is the right fit for you. Childcare is available. There is a $100 interview fee, due at time of interview and payable by cash or check, to cover the teacherâ€™s time. Please fax (408) 996-2770 or drop off the Family History form no later than Monday the day before the interview.</p>
