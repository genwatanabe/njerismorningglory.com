            <p>Founded in 2007, Njeriâ€™s Morning Glory School and Art Center has been bringing Waldorf education and a variety of art programs to children and adults in the San Jose area.  We are a comprehensive elementary school, offering full-time studies through fifth grade. Our art programs serve children (ages 3-15) and adults after-school, on weekends, over holiday breaks, and during the summer months.</p>

                    <p>If a tiny child has been able in his play to give up his whole living being to the world around him, he will be able, in the serious tasks of later life, to devote himself with confidence and power to the service of the world.</p>

                    <p>Education is a journey on which one acquires knowledge.
    It can be easy or difficult. Each one of us has our own pace.
    Some travel fast, some travel slowly, but once we acquire this knowledge,
    it's like riding a bicycle...we never forget.</p>

            <h3>Our Values and Mission</h3>
            <p>Our community of teachers and families represent a variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds, which we embrace in our educational values. We honor our international and multi-cultural community through the interconnected world-view of the Waldorf philosophy and pedagogy.</p>
            <p>Our work as teachers is to nurture the physical development of the young child, while cultivating the positive human values of compassion, reverence for life, respect, love of nature and other people, a social conscience, as well as developing cognitive, artistic and practical skills. The physical body is supported and the soul life of the child is affirmed and nourished as the ground for healthy, active thinking.</p>
            <p>We view both Waldorf Education and the Arts as healing forces in the world as they allow children and adults alike to find their greater sense of connection and purpose in the world.</p>
            <p>We continue to strive to make Waldorf Education and Art Programs available to all regardless of their economic situation.</p>
