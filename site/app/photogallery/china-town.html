        <p class="lead">After a busy day exploring Chinatown in San Francisco, the third grade enjoyed a leisurely dinner at a round table for 14 with a huge Lazy Susan in the center.   We walked out to the dining room's balcony with a view of Portsmouth Square, the waterfront center of the original city, where the first public school was built and where the children read out loud the poem by Robert Louis Stevenson carved on granite memorializing his visit to the Barbary Coast city.  We looked out at the Square's park, where elderly Chinese were gambling as San Franciscans have gambled there for 160 odd years, and the Friendship Bridge we had crossed to the Chinese Cultural Center.  Up Washington St. in the opposite direction, we could see the tiny pharmacy where we watched Chinese Medicinal prescriptions being filled as dry herbs were weighed and piled onto the counter.   Nearby on Grant St. we enjoyed tea-tasting, making historic plaque rubbings of the Barbary Coast Trail, viewing 1906 earthquake era photos at Old St. Mary's Cathedral and seeing the colorful balconies with flags flying for the Chinese New Year Parade tomorrow night.   So many memories by dinner time, but the best was yet to come.</p>

        <p class="lead">The beautiful Buddhist temple was at the top of a steep set of stairs on the 2nd floor of the Lee Lung Li Tong building off Grant St. After our visit there, we were admitted to the 3rd floor where the Mr. Lee's Kung Fu Club was assembling the longest dragon of the Chinese New Year Parade.  Entering a large room filled with lion heads and banners circling the walls, we saw a crew of people working to attach the skeleton of the huge dragon to the body.   Bamboo, wood, silk, rabbit fur, fleece and other natural materials make up the body of the dragon.  One man had his arms in the dragon's golden fish tail to secure the 'bones.'  One man asked the children to get inside the head of the dragon and flick the switch for the eyes to see if they would light up once again.  "The eyes are lit up," the children were thrilled to see!   We asked a student of Mr. Lee if the eyes are repainted every year and he said seriously that "once the dragon is awake, he is awake!"</p>

        <p class="lead">Tonight, at least 40 people will come to the Kung Fu Club's practice room and become part of the dragon; dressing in gold costumes, finding the dragon's body spiraling all around the floor of the room and ready to parade as he has for the past 30 years.   Mrs. Wang's third grade got to witness how the dragon unfolds at the close of a fascinating day, experiencing this beautiful part of historic San Francisco.</p>
