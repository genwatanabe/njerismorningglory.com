            <p class="lead">Our main lessons in ancient civilizations culminated at the Sunol Water Temple by celebrating the Olympiad of 330 B.C. which took place in Olympia, Greece. We conducted many competitions which reflected our understanding of these ancient sports: the discuss, footraces, the long jump, shot put among others. In honor of the Greek god Zeus we burned the eternal flame, ate greek food with the music of Greece, recited verses by Plato and dedicated ourselves to the spirit of the ancient Olympics.</p>
