        <p class="lead">In early May, the class and I, along with four indispensable parent chaperones, spent five glorious days communing with the light-soaked granite mountains, verdant meadows, flowering dogwoods, giant sequoias, and singing waterfalls of Yosemite.  We hiked, we sang, we played on the rocks, we listened to Miwok legends, we pondered the poetic musings of John Muir, we sketched what we saw during the day, and then we painted what we sketched late at night.  We experienced each waking moment with bodies and senses fully alive.</p>
        <p class="lead">Our most exhilarating time was the day we hiked up the Mist Trail to the top of Vernal Falls.  On our right, a sheer wall of granite stretched up to the sky.  On our left, a slippery granite slope slid down to a jumble of bone-crushing boulders washed by the mighty Merced.   Under our feet, an uneven granite staircase carved by gnomes with a wicked sense of humor called forth from all of us our inner mountain goats.  Our labored breathing could not be heard over the deep-throated singing of the waterfall.  Our bodies literally vibrated with it.</p>
        <p class="lead">Suddenly, in the midst of this drama, a child’s voice calmly floated up to me, “Mrs. Wang, I’m like the bear cub following in mama bear’s footsteps!”  This was a reference to the Miwok legend about the two bear cubs and El Capitan.</p>
        <p class="lead">The children and I (as well as the parents!) had forged a bond strong enough for them to follow me up a sheer granite cliff with calm confidence.  In so doing, they discovered for themselves that the force of the unrelenting waterfall, the pervasive mist, and the immovable granite was but a reflection of the power inside them!</p>
        <p class="lead">Blessings,</p>

        <h3>Hiking to Top of Vernal Falls</h3>
        <p class="lead">This 4.5-mile hike took us all day (10 to 4 pm).  The children did this hike with joy and awe.  No complaints.</p>

          <h4>Sentin, 3rd Grade</h4> <h6 class="lead">The trail was so steep, it was like hiking straight up a cliff!...The river bubbled and raged, creating little waterfalls.</h6>

        <h3>Thunderstorm / Hailstorm</h3>
        <p class="lead">We were caught in a storm on our way back to the cabin.  Mother Nature's dramatic display of power impressed them mightily.</p>

          <h4>Liam, 3rd Grade</h4>
          <p class="lead">We heard thunder.  It was so loud, it was like a thousand drums beating at the same time!</p>

          <h4>Kai, 4th Grade</h4>
          <p class="lead">I saw a flash in the sky and then heard, "Boom!"  I could not believe my eyes.  My friends said it was hail.</p>

        <div class="well well-small">
          <h4>Isaac, 4th Grade</h4>
          <p class="lead">The rain became a thunderstorm, and then it turned into a hailstorm!  The hail was as big as marbles, and they felt like marbles, too!</p>

        <h3>Junior Ranger Badge</h3>
        <p class="lead">Each child worked hard to earn his/her badge.  They signed a Junior Ranger Log Book (having their name recorded for all time in an official capacity impressed them tremendously) and were sworn in as a group.  Afterwards, everyone in the Visitor Center cheered and clapped (not just the parents).  Each child wore the badge with pride (and will again if given half the opportunity).</p>
